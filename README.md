# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

Hand gesture recognition system is used for interfacing between computer and human using hand gesture. We are going to implement a system that recognizes gestures input using webcam & performs the specified operation.This is very useful for a hands-free approach. It is useful in media player. A simple gesture could pause or play the movie or increase the volume even while sitting afar from the computer screen. It follows hand free approach. So, one can easily control this from long distance.

It recognizes gesture using webcam and performs specified operation such as the volume decreases by recognizing 2 fingers and the volume increases by recognizing 4 fingers

Hand Gesture Recognition system is a Computer Vision concept which is based on Machine Learning

We are going to implement a system which recognizes gestures input using webcam & performs the desired tasks. We have taken images as an input which are taken from webcam and it has been done using OpenCV in Python. Then we are going to implement Neural Network for recognizing the web-cam input and initialize some specific task to this input.
